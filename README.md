# hillclimbracing_handgesturecontrol
I created a gesture-controlled version of the Hill Climb Racing game using Python. Using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Pynput, I mapped hand gestures to keyboard inputsâ€”open hand for accelerate and closed hand for brake. It was a fun final project combining computer vision and automation.
